## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure scalability, testability, and maintainability.

### Layers
1.  **Presentation Layer**:
    *   **Pages & Widgets**: UI components built with Flutter.
    *   **State Management**: **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern for separating logic from UI.
2.  **Domain Layer**:
    *   **Entities**: Pure Dart classes representing business objects.
    *   **Use Cases**: Encapsulate specific business rules (e.g., `LoginUser`, `GetTasks`).
    *   **Repositories (Interfaces)**: Abstract contracts for data operations.
3.  **Data Layer**:
    *   **Repositories (Implementations)**: Concrete logic to fetch data.
    *   **Data Sources**: Direct connections to Firebase, Local Storage, or APIs.
    *   **Models**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) with JSON serialization.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

*   **Core**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (SDK 3.24+), Dart.
*   **State Management**: `flutter_bloc`, `equatable`.
*   **Dependency Injection**: `get_it`, `injectable`.
*   **Routing**: `go_router` for declarative navigation.
*   **Backend (BaaS)**:
    *   `firebase_auth` (Authentication)
    *   `cloud_firestore` (NoSQL Database)
    *   `firebase_storage` (File Storage)
*   **Local Storage**: `shared_preferences`, `flutter_secure_storage`.
*   **UI  & Animations**: `flutter_animate`, `flutter_screenutil`, `google_fonts`, `fl_chart`.
*   **Utilities**: `intl` (Formatting), `uuid` (Unique IDs), `logger` (Debugging).
*   **AI**: `google_generative_ai` (Gemini API).
